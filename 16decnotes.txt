what is https?
- its a secure way to send data between a web server and a web browser
- secure version of http
- stands for hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)
- uses PORT 443, different from HTTP which uses PORT 80

how does http work?
- read it from link above.
- this can get you paid big shmonies

asymmetric key encryption == LeBron having a dif. handshake w/ each player

SSL/TLS Certificates - Digital certificates that authenticate the identity of a website and enable an encrypted connection.

Must use AWS certificate manager bc it can handle the complexity of creating, storing, & renewing public and private SSL/TLS 

what is a web domain
- a human-friendly website address o the internet (.com)
- acts as a shortcut to complex IP addresses or long string of names


steps for route 53
- make sure ASG is up and running
- search for route 53 on AWS (region will be in "global") (AWS global thru us-east-1)
- register domain
	- type in domain and check (if it is available, register it)
- create a hosted zone
	- write domain name that you just bought
	- type - public
	- click create
- search acm on AWS (region will be back to specified region that your code is built in) (must create a certificate in each region)
	- request certificate
	- type - public -> click next
	- copy domain name into domain name area -> leave everything else default -> click request
create a 2nd ASG web app on port 80
- start w/ security groups
	- create security group -> name it "name of vpc" -sg-443 -> add inbound rules (SSH, HTTPS,HTTP) -> click create
	- edit load balancer security group -> add inbound rules (HTTPS) -> click save
- create a new launch template
- create target group
	- name "..." -443 -> leave protocol @ HTTP -> select appropriate vpc -> click create
	- dont need to register any targets
- verify certificate is issued in desired region
- edit load balancer
	- add listener (edit) -> select target group just created (-443) -> select certificate from acm -> click add listener
- create new ASG
	- name + "-443" -> select desired vpc -> select all PRIVATE subnets -> attach to an exisiting load balancer -> target group -> "-443"
	- desired cap. 6, min cap. 3, max cap. 9 -> choose a replacement behavior (for lab no policy, for job launch before terminating) -> review -> create
- go to route 53 and create a record
	- click create a record -> simple routing -> define a simple record -> leave record name alone -> ip address or another alue... -> type in IP address
	- easier AWS, simple way - "A" record should be selected, endpoint to alias to application  and classic load balancer -> region = desired region -> click dualstack."vpc name"
- verify if it works
	- http:// dns name
	- https:// dns name (connection wont be secure, but continue anyways)
----

main type of records to worry about
- "A" record returns a 32-bit number used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but also used for storing subnets. converts IPv4 address to domain name
- "CNAME" (Canonical name record) - alias of one name to another. the

"A" record is for the host directly, "CNAME" allows you to create another name of your choosing.

SG-LB must have port 80 and 443 this needs to be edited
SG-443 must have prt 80 and 443 this needs to be created
